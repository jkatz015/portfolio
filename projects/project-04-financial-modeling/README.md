# Project 4: Financial Modeling & Scenario Planning

> Multi-scenario financial model with 3-5 year projections and sensitivity analysis.

**Status:** Not Started

---

## Problem Statement

Companies need forward-looking financial models to:
- Secure funding (investors, banks)
- Plan capital expenditures
- Evaluate strategic decisions
- Set budgets and targets
- Stress-test business assumptions

**Goal:** Build a comprehensive 3-statement financial model with scenario analysis capabilities.

---

## Model Scope

### Three Financial Statements
1. **Income Statement** — Revenue, COGS, OpEx, Net Income
2. **Balance Sheet** — Assets, Liabilities, Equity
3. **Cash Flow Statement** — Operating, Investing, Financing

### Scenarios
- **Base Case** — Expected performance
- **Upside Case** — Optimistic assumptions
- **Downside Case** — Conservative/stress assumptions

---
